# Stochastic EM Channel Modeling
The stochastic EM channel modeling in scattering environment using a probabilistic framework. For the technical details please refer to the paper "**Electromagnetic Channel Modeling and Capacity Analysis for HMIMO Communications**" (has been accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications). 

>This paper presented a universal EM-compliant channel model for HMIMO communication systems based on stochastic Greenâ€™s functions. By incorporating a large number of planar waves, the proposed channel can be statistically represented
in a probabilistic framework. The asymptotic channel capacity and capacity region are derived based on the physics-oriented channel models.
